&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DISCLAIMER&lt;/em&gt; I have bad writing skills and poor grammar so please bear with me T-T I am just doing this for fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I would try something creative and make my own personal website! It has been a project
I have been thinking about making for a couple years now and now I am going to to my best to get this thing rolling!
I will probably use this site for sharing photography, recording my life, and just talking about whatever I want to
ramble on about. I hope that whoever you are, that you enjoy a glimpse into the life of Ronald. ¯_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Took this photo on August 20, 2022 to show off my swanky new haircut for someone who asked!
Thought I looked pretty good, hope you can agree with me :/ but if not that is ok, we are all entitled to our
own opinions! :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
