Hello world!

*DISCLAIMER* I have bad writing skills and poor grammar so please bear with me T-T I am just doing this for fun.

I thought I would try something creative and make my own personal website! It has been a project 
I have been thinking about making for a couple years now and now I am going to to my best to get this thing rolling!
I will probably use this site for sharing photography, recording my life, and just talking about whatever I want to 
ramble on about. I hope that whoever you are, that you enjoy a glimpse into the life of Ronald. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

> own opinions! :)
